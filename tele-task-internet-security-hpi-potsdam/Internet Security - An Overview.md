## Internet Security - An Overview

### Advantages Of Internet:

- Rapid Access to latest information (up-to-date).
- Mass Heterogenous, and integrated media - text, audio, video...
- Electronic Banking, Commerce, and Government.
- Low communication cost.
- Internet Of Things (IoT), Smart World, Industry 4.0

### Evolving Internet:
- We constantly adapt to new technologies and changes on the internet.
- We process informationa and conduct business in new ways.

### International Changes:
- Political boundries play no role in the internet.
- Different cultures and languages are present on the internet.
- No (real) standard against cyber crime.

### Nowaday's Internet
- Increased number of entry point's.
  - Personal Networks: Home, Work, Mobile.
  - Public Networks: Coffee Shops, Airports, Hotels, etc.
- Internet is everywhere: Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, Desktops, Refrigerators, Cars, etc.
-  Increased usage of internet for Interal Infrastructure. This is termed as Intranet and used in companies, schools, and government.
-  Danger of loss of confidental information. (competition, publicity!)

### Internet Based Information Systems
- Non-Availability of computer systems and databases.
- Loss of data.
- Loss of confidentiality. (Competition, publicity)
- Sabotage
  - Intrustion via 'malware' (malicious software). (Trojan, Virus, Worm, Spyware, Adware, etc.)
  - Obstruction of management.
  - Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks.
- Spoofing: Falsification of data. (IP, DNS, Email, etc.)
- Unauthorized access to data.

### Systemtic Problems of Internet Security
- Internet was never designed as a global communication system. In fact, it started out as a research project. It was not designed to be secure. Researcher's wanted to exchange information between multiple operating systems (different) and they were a closed and trusted community.
- Security was not a primary goal.
  - Looking into Internet Standard's or generally known as RFC (Request For Comments) Document's. You'll find a typical statement like this: "Security issues are not discussed in this memo."
- No single entity, no single Internet Authority, no Single Govermental body can completely control the internet.
- The internet became so secure that people did'nt wait for secure protocols.

### Internet is an easy target
- Internet has billions of entry point's worldwide.
- Millions of interconnected networks.
- Open System Culture's.
- Many Design Flaws. (Contribution from many people.)
- Huge Programming Errors (on top of design errors) which can be exploited.
- A large number of security flaws.
- Easy access and use of hacking tools.
  
### Changing Nature Of The Threat's
- Complexity of the internet, Protocol's and applications are increasing with our realiance on them.
- Internet has become a central infrastructure itself.
- Attacking the internet is easy, low risk and hard to trace.
- Intruders are often well prepared and organized.
- Intrusion/Hacking tools are:
  - Increasingly Sofisticated.
  - Easy to use, especially by novice intruder's.
  - Designed to support large-scale attacks.
- Source Code is not always required to exploit a vulnerability.

### Who are the intruders?
- Insider's.
- Computer Specialist's.
- Teenage Intruder's. (Script Kiddies), (Curiosity)
- Underground Hacker's. (Political Agenda)
- Terrorist's and Criminals. 
- Industrial Spies.
- Foreign government intelligence service's.

### Improved Opportunities for Intrusion
- Rapid adoption of computer and network technologies.
- Expansion of Internet and E-Commerce.
- Thousands of exploitable vulnerabilites.
- Lack of awareness regarding information security (Human Factor, Lazy, Weak Passwords)
- Shortage of qualified system and network administrator's and information security staff.
- Lack of applicable laws and means of enforcemnet.
- International Scope.

### Success
Success of internet makes's it a huge target and the number of people, number of services.
- 1993: Explosive Expansion in every-day use of Internet by 'Introduction of WWW' and the development of Web Browser's with Graphical User Interface (GUI). (NCSA MOSAIC)
- Industry and economy perceived potentials of today's communication possibilities.
- Plenty of current commerical and private applications have made the internet a central infrastructure and a 'global marketplace'.
- With the Internet Of Things (IoT), numerous new (low-power) devices are connected to the internet.

Commerical use of Internet has led to an extreme increase in computer and cyber crimes.
- Risk to Computer System's themselves.
- Risks to the Internet-Connection.
- Risk to Enterprise Intranet's


### Most Common Attacks
- Spoofing: Falsification of data. (IP, DNS, Email, etc.). Usage of fake identity. Mainly used to prepare or obfuscate other attacks.
  - Most common current world example is Twitter Bot's (Under Verified Checks/Names) that post fake redirect links to phishing sites.
- Defacement: Maliciously change the appreance of a web site to demonstrate hacking knowledge and security flaw's.
- Sniffing: Intercepting data packets on a network such as Wireless, Wired, etc. Monitoring data transmitted over a network.
  - It is done via both hardware and software.
  - Sniffers can be extremely dangerous to a network's security because they are impossible to detect as they only monitor data and do not modify it, hence the parties are not aware of the sniffing.
- Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks: Overloading a system with requests to make it unavailable to legitimate users.
  - Computers with access to internet get bombarded with requests from a single source or multiple sources via numerous IP-packets simultaneously.
  - As a consequence, the system is overloaded and cannot respond to legitimate requests. Hence, Normal users are unable to access the system.
  - In worst cases, the system crashes.
  - Sometimes, the system restarts in default setting's which can act as a entry point from documentation.
- Malware: Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses.
  - Viruses: Destructive piece of code loaded onto a computer without the owner's knowledge. Most viruse's can replicate themselves locally and spread to other computers.
  - Worms: Programs or Algorithms that replicate themselves (over computer netwroks) and spread to other computers usually performs malicious actions.
  - Torjan Horses: Destructive Program that is masqueraded as a legitimate program. Unlike viruses, trojan horses do not replicate themselves.
  - Backdoor/Rootkits: Software, which enables a remote user to gain access to a computer or computer network. It is usually installed by a hacker to enable access to a computer at a later time. It also hides the presence of a hacker's access usually for a long period of time and espionage.
  - Botnet: Collection of multiple infected computers that run autonomously and are controlled by a command-and-control server. (C&C Server)
  - Exploitation of Software Bugs: Often software bugs are misused by hacker's and computer criminals to attack system's.
  - Phising (Social Engineering): Attack Method that tries to find out passwords for online banking or other Internet/Intranet Services.
  - Physical Security Risks: Unlocked server rooms, password pinned under keyboard, etc.

### General Risks of Interconnected IT-Systems

There are dangerous risks for electronic information systems even **without Internet Connection**
- Non-Availability of computer systems and databases.
- Loss of data, misuse of data, theft of data.
- Human Factor (often the weakest link in security):
  - Defective or Uncomplete System Configuration.
  - Missing or defective data backup.
  - Intrusion of viruses by usage of phising or private data. (files on CD-ROM's, USB Sticks)
  - Faulty Operation. (unintentional deletion of data, etc.)


### Basic Risks:
Every data transfer within an open network has risks, e.g.:
- Falsification of data.
- Forgery of a certain addresser.
- Online-Shopping/Baking Fraud.
- Illegal or dubious online-business practices.
- Violation of data protection.
- Uncertain law in cyber space.

## Conclusion

The central aim is to prvoide fundamental knowledge about various security weaknesses of IT-Systems that are interconnected by Internet.

- To evaluate the risks of the Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- To design and implement security measures to protect against the risks of the Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT).
